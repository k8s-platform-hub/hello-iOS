# conf

This directory holds configuration for clusters added to this Hasura project. The configuration is templated and used for managing multiple clusters.

Templates are written in [pongo2](https://github.com/flosch/pongo2), a Django-syntax like templating-language.

A cluster in a hasura project is a kubernetes cluster with Hasura platform installed on it. The configuration that defines a cluster is derived by compiling the info present in this directory. Each file describes a particular part of the configuration. 

While rendering the template, a context variable called `cluster` will be available. This is an extension of the cluster object present in `clusters.yaml` file. Apart from the keys present in `clusters.yaml`, a key called `metadata` with some cluster specific information will be present. 

If you need to add your own variables, you can add them under the `data` key in `clusters.yaml` and this will be available as `cluster.data`

The entire context variable `cluster` can be viewed anytime using the command:

```bash
$ hasura cluster template-context
```

A typical context is as follows:

```yaml
name: h34-ambitious93-stg
alias: hasura
kubeContext: ambitious93
config:
  configmap: controller-conf
  namespace: hasura
metadata:
  filestore:
    volume:
      hostPath:
        path: /data/hasura.io/filestore
      name: filestore-pv
  gateway:
    externalIPs:
    - 111.222.33.44
    ports:
    - name: http
      port: 80
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 80
    - name: https
      port: 443
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 443
    - name: ssh
      port: 22
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 22
  namespaces:
    hasura: hasura
    user: default
  postgres:
    volume:
      hostPath:
        path: /data/hasura.io/postgres
      name: postgres-pv
  registry: null
  sessionStore:
    volume:
      hostPath:
        path: /data/hasura.io/redis
      name: redis-pv
data: null
```

All these keys will be available for templating as `cluster`
